# How it works
Just start a party in bullseye mode and make sure the script is properly loaded. If properly loaded it should already display a timer at 0 seconds in the lobby.
Start a bullseye game and the timer will automatically measure the time it takes you to finish the round. It does not measure the time between rounds.
At the end of the game you will get an overview on how long each round took.
